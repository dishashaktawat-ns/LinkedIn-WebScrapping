LinkedIn Scraping Approaches
This repository explores two different approaches for scraping or extracting structured data from LinkedIn for research and automation purposes.

1Firecrawl-based Pipeline (linkedin-pipeline)
Uses the Firecrawl framework for pipeline-based crawling and extraction.

Designed to leverage Firecrawlâ€™s modular pipeline system.

Limitation: Firecrawl currently does not support LinkedIn pages directly, which makes this approach partially incomplete.

Useful as a reference for how Firecrawl pipelines can be structured.

2. Open-source Scraper (linkdin_scrp)
Implements an alternative open-source approach for scraping LinkedIn profiles and data.

Does not depend on Firecrawl.

Provides a more direct and functional solution compared to the Firecrawl pipeline.

Can be extended further depending on project requirements.
